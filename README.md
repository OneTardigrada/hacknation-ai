## What is Mylo?

Local cafés sit empty at 3 PM and overcrowded at 1 PM. Coupons don't fix that — **context** does.

**Mylo** is a generative city-wallet that fuses four real-time signals (weather, hour, geofence distance, merchant goal) into a single, structured prompt and asks an LLM to generate one perfect, time-boxed offer — streamed live to the customer's phone.

Three surfaces, one brain:

| Surface | Role |
|--|--|
| **Consumer phone** | Receives one swipeable offer card with QR redemption + countdown |
| **Merchant tablet** | Configures rules, sees pre-order queue, quiet-hour analytics, share-count |
| **City boardgame map** | Stakeholder view — geofences, merchants, live offer pulses |

---

## Key features

- **AI-generated offers** — streaming JSON from OpenAI, progressively rendered as tokens arrive
- **Deterministic fallback** — works fully without an API key (rule-based pipeline)
- **Geofencing** — Haversine-based distance + radius rings
- **Pre-order flow** — full state machine from intent → queue → ETA
- **QR + cashback redemption**
- **Wallet ID** — pseudonymous token, never PII to merchants
- **Friends layer** — opt-in social graph + share-codes with share-count on the merchant dashboard
- **Transaction history** — auditable, one-tap erasable
- **Settings & consent** — granular opt-ins for location, weather, transactions, friends (GDPR-konform)
- **On-device SLM path** — `lib/slm-layer.ts` sketches a small-language-model fallback for full privacy
- **Demo tools** — persona selector, time machine, scenario presets, seasonal toggle

## Tech stack

| Layer | Tools |
|--|--|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router, route handlers) |
| Language | React 19 + TypeScript (strict) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4, glassmorphism, Sparkassen red `#E60000` |
| Motion | Framer Motion 12 |
| Maps | MapLibre GL + react-map-gl |
| Icons | Lucide React (100% SVG) |
| Charts | Recharts |
| AI | OpenAI streaming (with deterministic fallback) |
| External signals | OpenWeatherMap (with mock fallback) |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20 or later** (check with `node -v`)
- **npm 10 or later** (ships with Node)

### 1 — Install dependencies

> **Important:** all commands must be run from inside the `city-wallet/` folder, **not** the repo root.

```powershell
cd city-wallet
npm install
```

### 2 — (Optional) configure environment

Create `city-wallet/.env.local` if you want live LLM + weather data. The app works without it — it falls back to a deterministic offer pipeline and mock weather.

```bash
# city-wallet/.env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=...
```

### 3 — Run the dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 4 — Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
npm run start
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### `npm run dev` fails with "Missing script: dev" or similar

You're in the wrong folder. Make sure you're inside `city-wallet/`:

```powershell
cd city-wallet
npm run dev
```

### Port 3000 already in use

```powershell
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### LLM offers look "too generic"

You're running without an `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The deterministic fallback is intentionally simple. Add a key to `.env.local` and restart.

### Map tiles not loading

The boardgame view uses MapLibre with a custom raster style. If your network blocks tile servers, the map renders an empty canvas — the rest of the app still works.

---

## Static reference pages

Once the dev server is running:
- **Tech stack architecture:** [http://localhost:3000/tech-stack.html](http://localhost:3000/tech-stack.html)

You can also open these HTML files directly from disk via `file://` — no server required.

---

## Privacy & GDPR

Mylo is built consent-first:

- Every signal (location, weather, transactions, friends) is individually opt-in.
- The wallet identity is **pseudonymous** — merchants only ever see a token.
- The LLM receives only four signals (weather, hour, distance, goal) — no PII, no transaction history.
- An on-device small-language-model path (`lib/slm-layer.ts`) is sketched for full-privacy generation.
- One tap clears history and the share-graph (right to erasure).
